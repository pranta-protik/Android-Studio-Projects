        Who Was Mark Twain?\n\n
        Mark Twain, whose real name was Samuel Clemens, was the celebrated author of several novels,
        including two major classics of American literature: The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and
        Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. He was also a riverboat pilot, journalist, lecturer,
        entrepreneur and inventor.
        \n\n\n\nEarly Life\n\n
        Twain was born Samuel Langhorne Clemens in the tiny village of Florida, Missouri,
        on November 30, 1835, the sixth child of John and Jane Clemens. When he was 4 years old,
        his family moved to nearby Hannibal, a bustling river town of 1,000 people.
        \n\nJohn Clemens worked as a storekeeper, lawyer, judge and land speculator,
        dreaming of wealth but never achieving it, sometimes finding it hard to feed his family.
        He was an unsmiling fellow; according to one legend, young Sam never saw his father laugh.
        \n\nHis mother, by contrast, was a fun-loving, tenderhearted homemaker who whiled away
        many a winter\'s night for her family by telling stories. She became head of the household
        in 1847 when John died unexpectedly.
